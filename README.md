# URI-Solved-Problems

This is an open source code compilation for users of URI Online Judge.

Here Iâ€™ve added some URI-problem solutions in C language. But, as a programmer, I strongly suggest you to try to solve the problems by yourself first.

I'm going to keep commiting more solutions, so feel free to star this repository.

Ciao :))
